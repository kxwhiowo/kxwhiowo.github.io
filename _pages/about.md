I am a final-year Computer Science undergraduate at the [University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk). I am from [Xiamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen), a coastal city in southeastern China.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Ruqi Zhang](https://ruqizhang.github.io/). Previously, I conducted research at HKU under the supervision of Prof. [Shuo Yang](https://shuoyang-1998.github.io/) and Prof. [Hengshuang Zhao](https://hszhao.github.io/).

Please check my CV and publications for my research interests.
