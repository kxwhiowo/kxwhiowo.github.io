Other Stuffs about me:

* I am an amateur piano lover. I have started playing the piano for 10+ years since 6 years old.

* I am a super enthusiast of rock music. My favourite bands are **Oasis** and **The Rolling Stones**.

* I have deep passion in **Table Tennis** and **Hiking**. My current setup is a Fan Zhendong ALC blade, with Tibhar K1 Plus on my forehand and Yasaka Hovering Dragon on my backhand.

* My current food plan is to discover **the best 5 burger restaurants** in the world. I've been rating all the burgers I've eaten for everyone's reference.
  * Hong Kong:

    * [Smash'D](https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-smashd-western-district-international-hamburger-r745157)(9.4/10) Best one in HK, definitely worth a try.

  * West Lafayette:
    * [BRU Burger](https://www.bruburgerbar.com/location/bru-burger-bar-lafayette-in/)(9.6/10) If you come to Purdue, don't miss it.

  * Vancouver:
    * [ICML](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025)(3/10) You cannot expect having anything good here.
    * [Roundhouse Lodge at Whistler Peak](whistlerblackcomb.com)(5.8/10) A cold burger...
    * [Ovaltine Cafe](https://www.ovaltine-cafe.com/)(7/10) Normal burger, not expensive, but the environmental outside was just as hell.
  * Prince George:
    * [Nancy O's](https://www.nancyos.ca/)(8.5/10) Not bad for the BBQ flavor, but not too juicy.
    * [VIA Train](https://www.viarail.ca/en)(4/10) A frozen burger, but not that bad compared to its price.
  * Banff:
    * [The Eddie Burger](https://www.eddieburgerbar.ca/menus)(8/10) I believe they have skills to make a wonderful one, but the blue cheese company with jalapeno was just not a good idea.
