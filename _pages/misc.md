Other Stuffs about me:

* I am an amateur piano lover. I have started playing the piano for 10+ years since 6 years old.

* I am a super enthusiast of rock music. My favourite bands are **Oasis** and **The Rolling Stones**.

* I have deep passion in **Table Tennis** and **Hiking**. My current setup is a *Fan Zhendong ALC* blade, with *Tibhar K1 Plus* on my forehand and on my backhand.

* My current food plan is to discover **the best 5 burger restaurants** in the world. I've been rating all the burgers I've eaten for everyone's reference.
  * Hong Kong:  
    * [N+ Burger](https://www.nplusburger.com/)(9.3/10) Ordered the truffle brisket one. Amazing, soft but chewy bread, truffle sauce brought strong flavor around your mouth.
    * [Honbo](https://www.openrice.com/zh/hongkong/r-honbo-%E7%81%A3%E4%BB%94-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E8%8F%9C-%E6%BC%A2%E5%A0%A1%E5%8C%85-r522819)(9.2/10) They say it is the best one in HK even top 3 burger restaurants in the whole world, well I kinda agree with that...
    * [Smash'D](https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-smashd-western-district-international-hamburger-r745157)(9.4/10) Best one in HK, definitely worth a try.
    * [Mirror Burger](https://www.mirrorburger.com/)(8.8/10) 平靚正。
    * [Aster by Poppy](https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-aster-by-poppy-sheung-wan-american-r897170)(8.2/10) A huge fish burger, English style. But it is kinda fishy, and since the fish inside is too huge, you cannot eat the bun and fish at the same time, which may seem weird.   
    * [Flying Butcher Hong Kong](http://www.flyingbutcher.com/)(8/10)
    * [HoHon Eatery](https://www.instagram.com/hohoneatery/)(7.8/10) Too cheesy, no greens at all.
    * [Dare](https://www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/r-dare-western-district-western-r595274)(5/10) It's really hard to find a burger dry like this.
    * [Shake Shack](https://www.shakeshack.com.hk/en-HK/)(7.5/10) Popular choice, average as well.
    * [Five Guys](http://fiveguys.com.hk/)(8.1/10) Free peanuts.
    * [Mcdonalds](https://mcdonalds.com.hk/en/?srsltid=AfmBOopCTePz-3wZ-PWViuX6yT-xJsk-7OhNrYkTz4jWR7-31exSkDte)(6/10) You know, as a baseline...
  * West Lafayette:
    * [BRU Burger](https://www.bruburgerbar.com/location/bru-burger-bar-lafayette-in/)(9.6/10) If you come to Purdue, DO NOT miss it.
    * [The Bryant Food and Drink Co.](https://www.thebryantwl.com/)(7/10) Fraud.
  * Chicago:
    * [Billy Goat Tavern]([places.singleplatform.com](https://www.billygoattavern.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorhYcPvKmqhU_gQELIK9T2bFfZ8GXIqQAhqzFhCiAYTJQYQ_bda))(6.1/10) Actually not a place for eating burgers but a place for watching sports and experience nostalgic environment.
  * Vancouver:
    * [ICML](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2025)(3/10) You cannot expect having anything good here.
    * [Roundhouse Lodge at Whistler Peak](whistlerblackcomb.com)(5.8/10) A cold burger...
    * [Ovaltine Cafe](https://www.ovaltine-cafe.com/)(7/10) Opened in 1940s, they keep the decorations as the orginal one. Normal burger, not expensive, while the environmental outside was just as hell.
  * Prince George:
    * [Nancy O's](https://www.nancyos.ca/)(8.5/10) Not bad for the BBQ flavor, but not too juicy.
    * [VIA Train](https://www.viarail.ca/en)(4/10) A frozen burger, not that bad compared to its price.
  * Banff:
    * [The Eddie Burger](https://www.eddieburgerbar.ca/menus)(8/10) I believe they have skills to make a wonderful one, but the blue cheese with jalapeno was just not a good idea.
